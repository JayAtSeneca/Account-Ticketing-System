# Account-Ticketing-System

## Objectives:

Developed a system for tracking account tickets that essentially keeps track of system issues that customers report. Customers will contact assistance by phone or email when they run across issues. In order to notify the customer when a solution is available, the person handling the support request will establish a ticket for the request that includes the specifics of the issue and the customer's contact information.

## Result:

## Output using Python Script

You can make your own "Sample input file"  and save it as the name " a2ms2_4-long-inputs.txt" to get the quick output. Althought, if you just want to check the output, I have posted the sample file and script for the python as well.
